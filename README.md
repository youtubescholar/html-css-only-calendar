# html-css-only-calendar
This is a calendar that uses only html and css.  The primary purpose is to show users a weekly schedule.  I am developing this for my friends.

I have no educational background in coding or anything like that, I'm mostly fumbling around trying to make this work.  Though I am very motivated to get this right.  If there was a simple way to prepare somebody for their week, then that's what I want to achieve.  Also this may be helpful for trainers and helpers, to show their typical schedule, given recurring appointments.  Thanks, you can do whatever you want with this code.
